  <h3>Atomic Number 59</h3>
  <p>Praseodymium is a chemical element with symbol Pr and atomic number 59. Praseodymium is a soft, silvery, malleable and ductile metal in the lanthanide group. It is valued for its magnetic, electrical, chemical, and optical properties.[4] It is too reactive to be found in native form, and when artificially prepared, it slowly develops a green oxide coating.</p>
